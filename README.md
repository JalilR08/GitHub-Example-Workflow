# GitHub Team Work Flow - CSCI 234
* One member of the team fork the GitHub-Example-Workflow repository from the GitHub gregschaper account.
* The team member that forked the repository needs to add all the members of the team as contributors using their Moravian email address to invite them.
* Each team member accepts the invite.
* Each team member will clone the repository to their local machine.
* The team member that forked the repository will add code for the Team class and add their name as a team member. Then they will push the resulting Java code files back to the forked repository.
* Each other team member will in turn (one at a time):
    * pull the current version of the repository
    * Modify the code to add their name as a team member
    * Check to see that the project runs
    * When correct, push the Java code files back to the repository
* Each team member will then pull the modified code from the repository and run the Java program to make sure it is working correctly - prints the team name (number) and the names of the members of the team.
* The team member that forked the repository will then issue a pull request to merge the team's code with the upstream repository in the gregschaper account.
* The instructor will accept the merge request for each team.
* The instructor will pull the current version of the program from the repository and run the resulting Java code. All team numbers and members should get displayed to the monitor.
